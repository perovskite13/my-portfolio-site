                            Music inspires Joanne in a way that coding does.

                            Joanne is also a harpist, pianist and arranger who strives to convey her music interpretations through her harp, piano and audio production skills. Constantly inspired by video game and film music, she likes experimenting with soundscape, synths and ambience.
